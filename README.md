## Overview

**DTMS Platform** is an OpenShift-based distributed monitoring system designed to simulate and monitor multi-site data transfers across heterogeneous infrastructure.

This project demonstrates modern cloud-native patterns including distributed monitoring, observability, and reliability engineering in resource-constrained cluster environments.

### Key Capabilities

- 🌐 **Multi-site transfer exporters** (SITE_A, SITE_B, SITE_C)
- 📊 **Real-time metric collection** with Prometheus
- 📈 **Visualization** with Grafana dashboards
- 🤖 **Anomaly detection** using Isolation Forest ML
- 🚀 **Streaming pipeline** with Kafka + Spark
- 🔌 **REST API** powered by FastAPI
- ✅ **Data freshness validation** (Go microservice)
- 📉 **Correlation analytics** via Kubernetes CronJobs
- 🐳 **Containerized deployment** on OpenShift
- ⚡ **Resource-optimized** for strict **3 vCPU quota** environments

---

## Architecture

The system follows a distributed producer-consumer pattern with centralized observability and batch analytics.

    end

    end
```

### Data Flow

1. **Exporters (A/B/C)** write simulated transfer data to a shared PVC
2. **Anomaly Exporter** reads data and applies Isolation Forest detection
3. **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from all services
4. **FastAPI** aggregates anomalies and provides REST interface
5. **Go Service** validates data freshness in real-time
6. **CronJob** runs periodic correlation analytics

## Core Features

### 🔹 Multi-Site Monitoring

Three independent exporters simulate distributed transfer activity across heterogeneous sites, replicating real-world multi-datacenter scenarios.

### 🔹 Centralized Metrics

Prometheus scrapes comprehensive metrics:
- Transfer throughput and latency
- Anomaly detection scores
- Streaming event rates
- Data freshness heartbeats
- System health indicators

### 🔹 Anomaly Detection

Implements **Isolation Forest** machine learning model:
- Detects approximately **5%** anomalous transfers
- Real-time scoring based on transfer patterns
- Publishes anomaly ratios and confidence scores
- Adaptive threshold management

### 🔹 Streaming Pipeline

Built on **Kafka + Spark Streaming**:
- High-throughput event processing
- Per-batch aggregation
- Real-time metric exposure
- Fault-tolerant architecture

### 🔹 Data Freshness Service

Lightweight **Go microservice** for reliability monitoring:
- Polls API to validate system liveness
- Computes per-site data freshness metrics
- Exposes `dtms_data_fresh_seconds` and `dtms_data_fresh_ok`
- Minimal resource footprint

### 🔹 Correlation Analytics

**Kubernetes CronJob** for batch processing:
- Analyzes anomaly patterns vs throughput
- Computes correlation coefficients
- Automated execution every 10 minutes
- Exports findings to monitoring stack

### 🔹 Resource-Constrained Design

Engineered for sandbox and edge environments:
- **Hard Limit**: Operates under **3 vCPU** request quota
- **Memory Optimized**: Minimal footprint per service
- **Storage Efficient**: Shared RWX PVC strategy
- **Cost-Effective**: Suitable for free-tier clusters

## Design Decisions

### Why Go for Freshness?

- **Lightweight**: 10x smaller memory footprint vs Python equivalent
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond response times
- **Polyglot Showcase**: Demonstrates multi-language architecture
- **Sidecar Pattern**: Ideal for health-check microservices

### Why CronJob for Correlation?

- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoids continuous CPU usage
- **Batch Pattern**: Analytics valuable in periodic intervals
- **Quota Management**: Fits within 3 vCPU constraint
- **Kubernetes Native**: Leverages built-in scheduling

### Why Shared PVC (RWX)?

- **Simplicity**: No external object storage (S3) needed
- **Unified Source**: Single source of truth for all readers
- **Sandbox Friendly**: Works in constrained environments
- **Cost Effective**: No egress charges

---

## Limitations

- **Sandbox Optimized**: Tuned for development clusters, not production-scale
- **Kafka Configuration**: Single broker, limited Zookeeper resources
- **Security**: No TLS between internal services (demo environment)
- **Scaling**: Not currently configured for horizontal pod autoscaling
- **Persistence**: Limited retention policies for demo purposes

---

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Horizontal scaling with ReplicaSets
- [ ] PushGateway integration for correlation metrics
- [ ] Helm Chart packaging
- [ ] GitLab CI/CD pipeline automation
- [ ] Alertmanager integration for anomaly thresholds
- [ ] Synthetic fault injection testing
- [ ] TLS/mTLS for service mesh
- [ ] Multi-cluster federation support
- [ ] Advanced ML models (LSTM, Prophet)
- [ ] Cost optimization metrics
